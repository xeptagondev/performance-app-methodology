## Transparency Index

This is the global indicator.&#x20;

### Introduction to Indicator

### Calculation of Scoring.

Publish What You Fund Score = Indicator Score

The traffic light indicator methodology for this indicator is:

* Green = 80+
* Yellow = 60+
* Red = <60

{% hint style="info" %}
This is aligned with the Very Good / Good / Fair scoring at Publish What You Fund

This is the indicator for Country & Bureau levels.&#x20;

### Calculation: &#x20;

1\. Define the rollup\_ou\_description to filter: &#x20;

Filters the DataFrame df\_UNDP\_PROJECTS by selecting only the rows where the value in the 'rollup\_ou' column matches the value stored in the variable target\_rollup\_ou (note: which is 'ALB' in this case as an example).&#x20;

&#x20;

2\. Calculates the count of projects for each unique project status in the dataframe if count>0.&#x20;

The statuses are:&#x20;

* Financially Closed&#x20;
* On Going&#x20;
* Operationally Closed&#x20;
* Submit for Operational Close &#x20;
* Submitted for Financial close&#x20;

3\. Visualization - Grouping projects by project status and counting the number of projects in each status.&#x20;

&#x20;

4\. Filter data by specified project statuses: Select rows from the dataframe where the 'PROJECT\_STATUS' column matches the specified status values: 'On Going', 'Operationally Closed', and 'Submit for Operational Close'.&#x20;

&#x20;

Then remaining visualizations are done using this filtered dataframe.&#x20;

&#x20;

5\. Visualization: creates a horizontal bar chart showing the number of projects by project type, with the bars colored in sky blue except for the bars representing projects with null Project\_Type, which are colored in red.&#x20;

Grouping projects by project type and counting the number of projects in each type - First, count the occurrences of each unique project type in the 'PROJECT\_TYPE' column. Then resets the index and renames the columns to 'Project\_Type' and 'Count' respectively to prepare the data for visualization. &#x20;

Then, filters the dataframe to select rows where the 'PROJECT\_TYPE' column is null and counting projects with null Project\_Type. After that, adding the count of projects with null Project\_Type to the dataframe. Then created a bar chart including the rest of the project types.&#x20;

&#x20;

6\. Visualization: Counting the number of projects with and without descriptions - counts the number of non-null values in the 'PROJECT\_DESCRIPTION' column and then calculates the number of projects without descriptions by subtracting the count of projects with descriptions from the total number of projects. Then created a bar chart and annotated each bar with its respective count.&#x20;

&#x20;

7\. Visualization: Counting the number of projects with and without PROJECT\_TYPE - calculates the number of non-null values in the 'PROJECT\_TYPE' column and then calculates the number of projects without a 'PROJECT\_TYPE' by subtracting the count of projects with 'PROJECT\_TYPE' from the total number of projects. Then created a bar chart and annotated each bar with its respective count.&#x20;

&#x20;

8\. Visualization: creates a horizontal bar chart, annotates each bar with its respective count - Computes various statistics about projects on such as:&#x20;

* Total number of projects&#x20;
* Projects with less than 10 characters in project name&#x20;
* Projects without description&#x20;
* Projects without implementing partner&#x20;
* Projects with description less than 80 characters&#x20;

&#x20;

Transparency Scoring for CO - Methodology:&#x20;

Step 1: Make sure having a filtered dataframe (rollup\_ou = \[mention CO], also, PROJECT\_STATUS'].isin(\['On Going', 'Operationally Closed', 'Submit for Operational Close').&#x20;

Step 2: Penalty Factors for More Severe Penalization (1 to 5): Define penalty factors for each indicator to adjust the severity of penalization - &#x20;

* Penalty factor for projects with names shorter than 10 characters = 1&#x20;
* Penalty factor for projects without a description = 2&#x20;
* Penalty factor for projects without an implementing partner = 4&#x20;
* Penalty factor for projects with descriptions shorter than 80 characters = 3&#x20;
* Penalty factor for projects without a project type = 5&#x20;

Step 3: Count of All Projects : Calculate the total number of projects for normalization purposes.&#x20;

Step 4: count the occurrences of projects in each noncompliance case:&#x20;

* projects with names shorter than 10 characters.&#x20;
* projects without a description.&#x20;
* projects without an implementing partner.&#x20;
* projects with descriptions shorter than 80 characters.&#x20;
* projects without a project type&#x20;

Step 5: Determine total number of projects for each indicator.&#x20;

Step 6: Scores Calculation:&#x20;

Calculation of Percentages: Calculate the percentage of non-compliant projects relative to the total number of projects for each indicator.&#x20;

Penalty Factor Application: Apply the penalty factors to the percentages of non-compliant projects instead of raw counts. This adjustment ensures that the severity of penalization is proportionate to the extent of non-compliance relative to the total project count.&#x20;

Scoring Calculation: Calculate the scores based on the adjusted percentages of non-compliant projects multiplied by 20. This scaling operation ensures that the scores fall within a range of 0 to 20.&#x20;

Finally, individual scores for each indicator, along with the total score out of 100 for the CO, are displayed. Note: With each indicator having a maximum of 20 points and 5 indicators, the maximum possible total score would be 100 points.&#x20;
